#+TITLE: Quantum Protocol Zoo Library of Atomic Functions for Quantum Networks

* Overview

This library provides atomic functions implementations and makes them available to several quantum simulation backends.

* Status

The library is under active development but in a very ealy stage. 

* Design principles
There exist many different quantum computing backends. The idea with this library was to abstract them away so that code running written using the library could be run on other backends, provided that the rest of the code not composed of functions defined by the library is not backend specific.

To do this, we instantiate the library by giving it a mapping and a node. The mapping is the translation of the backend specific way of calling elementary quantum operations, while the node is the actual quantum registers that are available to perform the computation. The node usually contains also some additional functions such as sending qubits to other nodes, receiving and sending entanglement etc. The differences have been abstracted away with the mappings for =simulaqron= and =qunetsim= . Other mappings have been considered and used but not made available most notably for =Netsquid=.

Feel free to add functions, or code new mappings by forking and pull-requesting insertion of your additions. Please keep us updated with your work so that we inform you of changes that could be breaking things.

* Usage
Look at the =examples/examples.py= file. The library is instantiated for each node (as if the nodes were independent computers, each loading its version of the library). 

Other sources of inspirations are the tests defined in the =tests= directory

New atomic functions will be added following the list established by extracting atomic functions from the Quantum Protocol Zoo.

* Testing

Tests can be run using =python setup.py test= at the root of the repository. 

The repository includes a tests directory that contains the file =test_qpz_atomics.py= which gathers all the tests implemented. It is using the =pytest= package to launch the tests and gather statistics, while being based on =hypothesis= for generating examples. 

For the tests to run, you need to have a quatum network simulator available and running. We have chosen to implement the tests using =simulaqron= as a backend, hence requiring a running simulaqron instance. This can be done typing the following: 
#+begin_src sh 
simulaqron set max-qubits 100
simulaqron start
#+end_src

Other backends could be used provided the tests are rewritten and the required backend is available and properly mapped in the library.
